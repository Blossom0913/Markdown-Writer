## Hi,Miss Q!

**&emsp;&emsp;Recent moist weather reminds me of those rainy days spent with you. Nonetheless it has been 3 months since I wrote something to you last time. I'd never felt such a strong sense of obligation to denote all remnants reluctant to you, which might already faded out in your mind.But I won't blame you. On the contrary,I owe you an apology at the bottom of my heart imminently like a guilty convict.**  

**&emsp;&emsp;I can't figure out who I am in your heart. A disturbing boy, an impractical daydreamer or an inhabited coward. But I know what I did merely escalated your indignation. Nevertheless, all these experiences, which I can't help recollecting like a nightmare,help me to comprehend the profound meaning of forgiveness and gratitude.**

**&emsp;&emsp;Just like that saying goes,"It's a blessing to see rain and thunder." I gradually started to accept the truth that you don't like me, embrace myself and cherish those who love me. Thus, I firmly believe that my love for you never ends up fruitlessly and meets no return. Though one day you'll exit my world without any herald. The enthusiasm, optimism and integrity I obtained from you remained constant past, now and future.**  

**&emsp;&emsp;I sincerely hoped that you will keep shining with all your glamour, sensibility and sympathy that exactly lighted up a boy's dreadful life once. At last, I really wish you a nice holiday and promising future.**
